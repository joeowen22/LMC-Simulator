LMC-Simulator
=============

A simulator for testing LMC programs. I have designed this to use as a testing aid for my computer architecture coursework at university. The code has been documented for you to understand how the program/simulation is working. I plan to sometime in the future implement a GUI to better show what is happening in the simulator.
